# ‚úÖ Simple To-Do List App

A clean and functional to-do list application built with **vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS**. This project demonstrates core JavaScript concepts, including DOM manipulation, event handling, and data persistence using `localStorage`. It's a classic project that showcases strong foundational web development skills.

## üí° Core Concepts Demonstrated

This project is a practical application of several fundamental web development concepts:

-   **DOM Manipulation:** Dynamically creating, updating, and deleting HTML elements using JavaScript to reflect the current state of the to-do list.
-   **Event Handling:** Using `addEventListener` to capture user interactions like button clicks (add, delete) and task toggles.
-   **`localStorage` API:** Persisting user data by storing the tasks array in the browser's local storage, ensuring the list is saved between sessions.
-   **Array Methods:** Utilizing JavaScript array methods like `forEach`, `push`, and `filter` to manage the list of tasks efficiently.
-   **Data Attributes:** Using `data-id` attributes to associate DOM elements with their corresponding data objects, making it easy to update or delete specific tasks.
